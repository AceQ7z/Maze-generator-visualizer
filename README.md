# 🐭 Maze Visualizer
A Python maze generator and solver using pygame, with real-time animation and controls.

## Features
- Recursive backtracking maze generation  
- DFS solving animation  
- Adjustable speed and pause/resume  
- Visualized shortest path
- 25x25 grid


## IMP NOTE!! :
- This is one of my first "big" projects is i gotta say this code isnt much optimised ;-;.
- The Gui is fixed at resolution 1200x750 and thus the window may clip out of screen for smaller resolution, so i advise changing the resolution of your screen to any adequatue size.


## Instructions :
- There really is nothing tbh, the actaull code is the "GUI.py" which comes with buttons and stuff for more control on what you are seeing.
- There is also a console based (text-based) version for those who cant run the GUI.py because of the resolution(which i am sorry for again ;-;) or just wanna check it out. its a smaller 7x7 grid version of the maze. Warning tho, this ones even more un optimised 😅).


## Explaination :
  Okay i suck at explaining but i will give you what i know,
